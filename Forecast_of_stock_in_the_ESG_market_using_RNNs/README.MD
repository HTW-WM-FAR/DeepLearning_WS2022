Please note: the project is split into four files. 

The R-files “alv_lr_arima” and “sap_lr_arima” contains the linear regression and ARIMA model for Allianz SE and SAP SE respectively. 

The Python-files “alv_lstm” and “sap_lstm” contains the LSTM model as well as some basic data exploration. 

The two datasets used can be found in the cvs-files “yahoo_alv” and “yahoo_sap”.
